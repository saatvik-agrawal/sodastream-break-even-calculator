# SodaStream Break-Even Calculator

This web-based calculator uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) to run Python code directly in the browser. It helps you determine how many 800ml bottles of soda you need to make with a SodaStream before it becomes more cost-effective than buying bottled soda. The calculator factors in the cost of the SodaStream machine, CO2 cartridges, syrup mix (sold per 9 liters), and compares it with the cost of buying soda per liter.

## Features

- **Python-Powered Calculations**: Leverages Pyodide to execute Python logic in the browser.
- **User Inputs**: Enter the cost of the SodaStream machine, CO2 cartridges, cartridge lifespan (in liters), syrup mix cost (per 9 liters), and bottled soda cost (per liter).
- **Instant Results**: Calculates and displays the break-even number of 800ml bottles.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: A simple web form for entering your data.

## How to Use

1. Visit the calculator on GitHub Pages: [SodaStream Break-Even Calculator](https://saatvik-agrawal.github.io/sodastream-break-even-calculator/)
2. Fill in the following details:
   - Cost of the SodaStream machine
   - Cost of CO2 cartridges
   - Lifespan of a cartridge in liters
   - Cost of syrup mix per 9 liters
   - Cost of bottled soda per liter
3. Click the "Calculate" button to view the results.

## Running Locally

If you prefer to run the calculator on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/saatvik-agrawal/sodastream-break-even-calculator.git

```
2. Navigate to the repository:
```

cd sodastream-break-even-calculator

```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (an internet connection is required to load Pyodide from the CDN).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & JavaScript**: For building the interactive web interface.
- **Python & Pyodide**: Executes Python code in the browser via WebAssembly.
